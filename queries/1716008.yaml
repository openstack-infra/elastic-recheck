# This is a general tracking query for all OVB infrastructure failures.
# It is intended to serve two purposes: First, to let us know when such
# failures are occurring, and second to notify users of what happened
# when their job fails in this way, since it may not be obvious to them
# what went wrong.  Please leave this query in place even if there are no
# recent hits for it.
