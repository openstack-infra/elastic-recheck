====================================
 Elastic Recheck Useful Point Tools
====================================

These are useful point tools that are examples of using elastic
recheck to get additionally useful information out of the
system. Items in this directory do not have unit tests,
intentionally. This is about useful examples, that are better shared
than left on people's hard drives to get lost in the mists of time.

All tools should have a -h which explain what they do.
